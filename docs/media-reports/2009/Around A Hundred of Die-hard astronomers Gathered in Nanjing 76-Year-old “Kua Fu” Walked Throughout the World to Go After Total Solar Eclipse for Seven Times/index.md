The opening ceremony of the seventh Bootes International astronomy exchange conference and travel of Jiangnan total solar eclipse was held in Nanjing yesterday. Around a hundred of overseas and domestic die-hard astronomers gathered in Nanjing to prepare to go to arrive at Dawu Town on July 22 to observe total solar eclipse. The tourist group was the most professional observation group in the country, including overseas and domestic astronomic photography veteran and students from astronomic school of international famous universities. 

What the reporter heard mostly in the interview was that “I wish the day of July 22 will have a good weather.”
Chen Zhiyi, a man of 76 years old, born in Macao, is dwelling in Toronto presently. He was the one with the largest age in the “go after total solar eclipse” group. It was the seventh times for him to “go after total solar eclipse” over the past 45 years. 
When Chen Zhiyi was young, he had to get rid of astronomy specialty which he was fond of due to his father’s opposition, and he had to select chemistry. After he worked, his most hobby was to research astronomy naturally. In 1964, total solar eclipse passed by Quebec province. At that time, Chen Zhiyi was studying for degree of doctor in Toronto University where the sky was full of stars from white clouds immediately, which gave him amazing feeling. That experience impressed him throughout his life. 
Since then, Chen Zhiyi has been infatuated with total solar eclipse. In order to observe total solar eclipse, he walked over the five continents, including German, Turkey, Australia, British...over the past 45 years. He has already observed total solar eclipse for 7 times. Chen Zhiyi said that what was unforgettable in these 7 times of observation of total solar eclipse was that in Africa. At that time, he saw the fantastic landscape of ten thousands of birds returning to their nests when it became dark. 
His German wife also became a fan of astronomy after being influenced by Chen Zhiyi. She has already traced and paid attention to total solar eclipse for fifteen years. They became “a real couple for total solar eclipse”.

“Astronomy is beside everyone, and it is the romance in accompany with stars.” Which is what Xie Renjiang goes after who is the owner of “Bootes Astronomy Forum” which was founded by him 10 years ago. 32-year-old Xie Renjiang has already become one of the members of “Royal Astronomical Society”. Presently “Bootes Astronomy Forum” covering 60,000 members has already become the largest astronomy forum in China. 

In 1997, Xie Renjiang observed total solar eclipse for the first time. At that time he was 20 years old, he came to Mohe solely to observe total solar eclipse at the ambient temperature of -40℃, which was a very special experience for him. The total solar eclipse in Mohe was lively telecast by CCTV for the first time. “The equipment was not advanced, film camera was till used at that time. I had to exhale at the camera constantly in the extremely cold weather, but the vapour coagulated instantly so that the shutter was frozen.” said Xie Renjiang, “I think that the most characteristic for the total solar eclipse in Mohe is that we could see Comet Hale-Bopp. It was the focus of controversy for whether comet was seen or not when total solar eclipse appeared, while it was proved to be seen at last.” However it was a pity for Xie Renjiang not to be able to shoot Comet Hale-Bopp and sun simultaneously because the two celestial bodies were relatively far away from each other at that time.
